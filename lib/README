This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries.
PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link into executable file.

The source code of each library should be placed in a an own separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/[here are source files]").

For example, see a structure of the following two libraries `Foo` and `Bar`:

|--lib
|  |
|  |--Bar
|  |  |--docs
|  |  |--examples
|  |  |--src
|  |     |- Bar.c
|  |     |- Bar.h
|  |  |- library.json (optional, custom build options, etc) https://docs.platformio.org/page/librarymanager/config.html
|  |
|  |--Foo
|  |  |- Foo.c
|  |  |- Foo.h
|  |
|  |- README --> THIS FILE
|
|- platformio.ini
|--src
   |- main.c

and target configuration in "platformio.ini":

[env:myenv]
platform = platform_name
board = board_name
framework = framework_name

then from "src/main.c|.cpp" you should add:

#include <Foo.h>
#include <Bar.h>

All libraries inside 'lib' folder will be built automatically.
In case you don't want to use a particular library that is in the 'lib' folder
(for example, there's a test library or a library incompatible with your project),
use the `lib_ignore` option in "platformio.ini".
